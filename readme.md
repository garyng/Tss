A dumb playlist management tool.

# (My) Workflow

1. Gather a bunch of tracks into a Spotify playlist, normally called `xxx (pending)`
1. Create two more playlists:
   - `xxx (good)`
   - `xxx (not good)`
1. Listen to all tracks
1. If the current track is good, move to `xxx (good)` and continue listening
1. If the current track is not good, move to `xxx (not good)` and skip

This project provides a simple interface for moving tracks between playlists.
